## About

<!-- TODO: Insert pics of our project here -->

### Cheems Chaps - The Au Pair

The Au Pair is a platform used to give control to parents. The Au Pair will assist them in finding and interactng with suitable Au Pairs who will be looking after their children. It will allow parents to minimize efforts to find Au Pair’s, provide schedules for their children, and review their activities and behavior through feedback from the Au Pair.

The Au Pair is a project created for the University of Pretoria's COS301 module. It was created by the Cheems Chaps team with members <a href="#daniel-azmanov">Daniel Azmanov</a>, <a href="#ruben-brits">Ruben Brits</a>, <a href="#kyle-pottinger">Kyle Pottinger</a>, <a href="#reece-stephenson">Reece Stephenson</a> and <a href="#seyuran-pillay">Seyuran Pillay</a>

## Daniel Azmanov

As a third-year computer scientist, I have developed an expansive knowledge and skill set, perfect for project development and management.   Over the years, I have learnt, and worked with, Java, C++, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and Angular, and other related technologies and frameworks.  I enjoy putting myself in many different work environments (technologies as well as team members) to broaden my knowledge, which has proved useful in my overall development as a software developer and project leader.

For the last 1.5 years I have been working as a software developer for a big company while doing Computer Science. Here I have picked up valuable skills for production ready software. My skills include ASP.NET Core MVC, React and Flutter on production level. I also have a lot of project-based experience with Angular, Ionic, Java and university related languages. I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge and skillset. I work hard and get the job done, while having fun!

Over the years of learning programming, I have become proficient in languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python. I also have project experience with, and am knowledgeable about, Angular and SQL. I believe my experience with web development and front-end development will prove beneficial to the success of this project and that my skills will help towards creating a pleasant and effective user experience.  I am always looking to improve my skill set and am always more than willing to work towards a better understanding in all regards.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100611949/167244616-62310b93-7b70-4aff-9fb3-b3af5aa04c97.png" align="left" height="150px"/>

I have learnt and used many programming languages and frameworks throughout my studies. My focus has mainly been on C++, Java, Python, PHP, SQL and JavaScript for backend programming languages, and HTML, CSS, for frontend languages. I have also worked with frameworks such as Angular, Ionic and Flutter, and know how to work with them proficiently. I have a creative outlook to programming. I enjoy learning new things as it gives me more opportunities to creatively solve problems.

## Seyuran Pillay 

[![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyolan-pillay-a603971b3)[![GitHub][github-shield]](https://github.com/priyo5)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100611949/167244623-60d184e0-29f2-49d7-86a1-d9b7cd0bce22.png" align="left" height="150px"/>

During the 7 years of my coding experience, I have learned a large variety of languages and technologies. I am proficient in JAVA, Python, C++, and JavaScript. This has enabled me to pick up new languages quickly and has exposed me to Frameworks like Angular and React and alternates to a relational database such as MongoDB. I love creating hobby projects, which has introduced me to hosting with AWS and Bash scripting along with web development in HTML, CSS, and PHP. I also have worked as technical support for an ISP. I believe it also gave me a strong work ethic for everything I do.
