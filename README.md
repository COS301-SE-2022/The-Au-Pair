As a third-year computer scientist, I have developed an expansive knowledge and skill set, perfect for project development and management.   Over the years, I have learnt, and worked with, Java, C++, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and Angular, and other related technologies and frameworks.  I enjoy putting myself in many different work environments (technologies as well as team members) to broaden my knowledge, which has proved useful in my overall development as a software developer and project leader.

For the last 1.5 years I have been working as a software developer for a big company while doing Computer Science. Here I have picked up valuable skills for production ready software. My skills include ASP.NET Core MVC, React and Flutter on production level. I also have a lot of project-based experience with Angular, Ionic, Java and university related languages. I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge and skillset. I work hard and get the job done, while having fun!

Over the years of learning programming, I have become proficient in languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python. I also have project experience with, and am knowledgeable about, Angular and SQL. I believe my experience with web development and front-end development will prove beneficial to the success of this project and that my skills will help towards creating a pleasant and effective user experience.  I am always looking to improve my skill set and am always more than willing to work towards a better understanding in all regards.

I have learnt and used many programming languages and frameworks throughout my studies. My focus has mainly been on C++, Java, Python, PHP, SQL and JavaScript for backend programming languages, and HTML, CSS, for frontend languages. I have also worked with frameworks such as Angular, Ionic and Flutter, and know how to work with them proficiently. I have a creative outlook to programming. I enjoy learning new things as it gives me more opportunities to creatively solve problems.

During the 7 years of my coding experience, I have learned a large variety of languages and technologies. I am proficient in JAVA, Python, C++, and JavaScript. This has enabled me to pick up new languages quickly and has exposed me to Frameworks like Angular and React and alternates to a relational database such as MongoDB. I love creating hobby projects, which has introduced me to hosting with AWS and Bash scripting along with web development in HTML, CSS, and PHP. I also have worked as technical support for an ISP. I believe it also gave me a strong work ethic for everything I do.
